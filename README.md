                                           Project Objective 
This is a project to control a PacMan image to simulate the PacMan moving across the screen and reversing direction and in doing so the project helps to learn how to control the Document Object Model or DOM.

To run the program click on the image and watch when the packman moves horizontally back and forth in reverse direction.

This project is to create PacMan with the click of a button and each of them will move on the browser window at their own pace. When you click the "Add PacMan" button, a new pacman should appear at a random position on the screen and when you click the "Start Game" button, the pacman created should start moving at random velocity on the screen. Finally, when a given pacman hits the edge of the screen, it should change position to stay within the frame of the web page.
